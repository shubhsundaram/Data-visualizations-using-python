# Data Visualization using Python
Created a comprehensive data visualization project in python, utilizing python libraries like Matplotlib and Pygal. 
produced insightful charts and graphs out of the data. employs web APIs to automatically request specific information from a website.

 #### The project is divided into three parts:
## 1.) Basic matplotlib and Pygal Graphs :

I learned to create simple plots with matplotlib like - 

![Figure_1](https://github.com/shubhsundaram/Data-visualizations-using-python/assets/108191939/7a1cadc7-bca2-406e-ac66-97f50282a0e1)

used a scatter plot to explore random walks like -

created a histogram with Pygal to explore the results of rolling dice of different sizes -

and many more creative graphs.


## 2.) Visuals obtained on two online data sets :

The first visual i obtained on a data-set which contains information of a region like daily high temp, humidity, height, daily low temp etc.
the figure shows the high and low temperature peaks during the year 2014.

The second visual i obtained is nothing but the world population data where countries are diveded into three groups according to their population size and each group is assigned to a different color:

and many more interesting insights.

## 3.) Visuals on the data obtained using Web APIs :

With the help of the first API we are able to fetch the data from github about the number of available python projects and python projects which are starred the most.

secondly we have obtained data from the Hacker Newsâ€™ API and get the results like :

In the output terminal you can clearly notice the fetched data about the articles published on this news website i.e "Title" , "Discussion Link"  and "Comments" of all the articles.






### Acknowledgements:

I am grateful to the author of the book "Python Crash-Course" who have delivered such an amazing content in his book.

this book really helped me to learn these concepts in detail and make me to finish this project.
